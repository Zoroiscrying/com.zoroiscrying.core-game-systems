## How to use

*Work In Progress*

## Install

### via npm

Open `Packages/manifest.json` with your favorite text editor. Add a [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html) and following line to dependencies block:
```json
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "npmjs",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
      "scopes": [
        "com.zoroiscrying"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "com.zoroiscrying.core-game-systems": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```
Package should now appear in package manager.

### via OpenUPM

The package is also available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com/packages/com.zoroiscrying.core-game-systems). You can install it eg. via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).

```
openupm add com.zoroiscrying.core-game-systems
```

### via Git URL

Open `Packages/manifest.json` with your favorite text editor. Add following line to the dependencies block:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.zoroiscrying.core-game-systems": "https://github.com/zoroiscrying/core-game-systems.git"
  }
}
```

### Tests

The package can optionally be set as *testable*.
In practice this means that tests in the package will be visible in the [Unity Test Runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.4/Documentation/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html).

Open `Packages/manifest.json` with your favorite text editor. Add following line **after** the dependencies block:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
  },
  "testables": [ "com.zoroiscrying.core-game-systems" ]
}
```
